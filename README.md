Flowchart:

-Remove punctuation marks from the text.
-Convert all the words to lowercase.
-Split the text into a list of words.
-Count the number of occurrences of each word.
-Calculate the relative frequencies (probabilities) of each word.
-Create a list of bigrams.
-Calculate the conditional probabilities of each word given the previous word in the bigram.
-Calculate the entropy assuming all words have the same probability.
-Calculate the entropy considering the individual probabilities of each word.
-Calculate the conditional entropy.
-Simulate the generation of words from a Markov source.
